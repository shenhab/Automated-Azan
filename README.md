# **Automated Azan ‚è∞üïå**  
*A Python-based tool to automate Azan (Islamic call to prayer) notifications using Google Home devices.*

## **üìå Features**
‚úÖ Plays Azan automatically based on your configured location and prayer times  
‚úÖ Supports Google Home speakers and speaker groups via `pychromecast`  
‚úÖ Multiple prayer time sources (ICCI and Naas mosque timetables)  
‚úÖ Special handling for Fajr prayer with optional pre-Fajr Quran radio  
‚úÖ WhatsApp notifications via Twilio integration  
‚úÖ Runs continuously as a reliable background service  
‚úÖ Automatic time synchronization via NTP  
‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring  

## **üß© Components**
The application consists of several components working together:

1. **`main.py`**: Main application entry point with the AthanScheduler class
2. **`prayer_times_fetcher.py`**: Fetches prayer times from different sources
3. **`chromecast_manager.py`**: Manages Google Home integration and audio playback
4. **`adahn.config`**: Configuration file for specifying location and device settings
5. **`azan.service`**: SystemD service file for running as a background service
6. **`.env`**: Optional environment file for Twilio API credentials

## **üöÄ Installation & Setup**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+** ([Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Pipenv** for dependency management ([Installation Guide](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/))
- **Git** for cloning the repository ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Google Home/Chromecast device** on the same network
- **Twilio account** (optional, for WhatsApp notifications)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Steps**
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shenhab/Automated-Azan.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Automated-Azan

# Install dependencies using Pipenv
pipenv install
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Application**

#### Basic Configuration
Edit the `adahn.config` file to set your speaker group name and preferred prayer time source:

```ini
[Settings]
speakers-group-name = YourGoogleSpeakerName
location = naas  # Options: naas, icci
```

#### WhatsApp Notification Setup (Optional)
If you want to receive WhatsApp notifications, create a `.env` file with your Twilio credentials:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_CONTENT_SID=your_content_sid
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886
RECIPIENT_NUMBER=whatsapp:+your_number
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application**
You can run the application in two ways:

#### a) Direct Execution
Start the application directly:

```bash
pipenv run python main.py
```

#### b) As a System Service (Recommended)
For continuous operation, install as a systemd service:

```bash
# Copy service file (may need sudo)
sudo cp azan.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable azan.service
sudo systemctl start azan.service

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status azan.service
```

## **üîç Prayer Time Sources**
The application supports multiple prayer time sources:

### **ICCI (Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland)**
Uses the official ICCI API for Dublin prayer times.

### **Naas Masjid**
Fetches prayer times from Naas Masjid's Mawaqit page.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration**

### **Prayer Time Handling**
- Fajr prayers play a special Fajr adhan sound
- 45 minutes before Fajr, Quran radio starts playing (can be modified in code)

### **Logs**
Logs are stored in `/var/log/azan_service.log` and include:
- Prayer time fetching status
- Scheduled prayer announcements
- Connection issues with Google Home devices
- WhatsApp notification status

## **üîß Troubleshooting**

### **Google Home Connection Issues**
- Ensure your Google Home device is on the same network as the server
- Verify the device name in `adahn.config` matches exactly
- Check firewall settings to allow mDNS discovery

### **Missing Prayer Times**
- Check internet connectivity to prayer time sources
- Verify that the timetable JSON files exist and are valid
- Force a refresh by setting `force_download=True` in the code

### **NTP Synchronization Problems**
- Ensure the system has internet access to reach NTP servers
- Check the system's time zone configuration
- Run `timedatectl status` to verify NTP synchronization

### **Service Not Starting**
- Check systemd logs with `journalctl -u azan.service`
- Verify Python and dependency installation
- Ensure proper file permissions

## **üí° Future Improvements**
- Web interface for easy configuration
- Support for more prayer time sources
- Customizable adhan sounds
- Mobile app integration
- Multiple language support
- Prayer time adjustments and calibration
